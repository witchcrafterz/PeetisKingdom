## Synopsis
You find yourself stranded in a strange world, with no memory on how you got here. You decide to explore this new found land and find yourself befriending unexpected creatures: a giant grasshopper, a talking octopus and a bird. You face dangers the like of smouldering hot magma and a very mean ornithologist! Your only hope to find you way home is with the help of the elusive reign of this strange land: Princess Peeti -- a jolly little chihuahua with a tiara up on her head!
